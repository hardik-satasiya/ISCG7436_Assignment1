## Design Patterns

MVC was used.

- Shape classes for models. Enums for tools and colours. Shapes could generate a UIBezierPath if requested.
- ShapeManager singleton for maintaining a list of shapes created.

- Controller was the ViewController for the main screen.
- Controller did all the drawing, tool and colour selection, and handling user input.

- View was the Scene for the above controller. 
- Includes a button bar for selecting the tool, buttons for selecting colours, trash button, and draw area.

- Utility Classes, perform very common tasks
- adjusting points and transitions to within a rectangle, and saving files.

## Additional features

- Work Universally, on iPad (Air, Pro, Mini), and iPhone (SE, 4, 5, 5s, 6, 6s, 6plus, 7, 7s, 7plus)
- Save image to Documents folder.
- Highlighting of current selected colour.
- Undo feature.
- Drawing area, to prevent drawing over the buttons and screen margins.

## Third party libraries

None were used.

## Improvements

- Drawing area should show a border so user knows where to draw.
- Clear Screen dialog could be proper popup dialog, and disappear if user tapped outside it.
- Save images to photo album, which requires requesting permissions.
